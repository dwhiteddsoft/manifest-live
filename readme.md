## Issue 1

Need to think through img, css, and js files. Most are '~/' or './'. We are rewriting the URL when it comes in becasue the containers are listening at somethimg. In our first cases we assumed they listened at root (/). We need to decide the guidance here and how we are going to do routing across teams and services
